Task
Objective
LAB 3 :
Create a base class named Vehicle with a method move that prints "Vehicle is moving". 

Then, create a subclass Car that overrides the move method to print "Car is driving". 

Instantiate an object of the Vehicle class and call the move method. Also, instantiate an object of the Car class and call the move method. 

Expected Output:
The move method of Vehicle should print "Vehicle is moving".
The move method of Car should print "Car is driving".

Constraint
The move method in both the base class and the subclass should not return any values, only print the output.
Ensure that the subclass method properly overrides the base class method.
